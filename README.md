# 2048

Authors: Neil Tengbumroong, Bernard Wong
Date: December 17,2018

A program for the game 2048 written in Java that runs on the desktop. The program includes all of the features from the original iOS game, plus added functionality that allows the users to specify different board dimensions from the standard 4x4 in the original game. To run, clone the repository and run 'java Gui2048' from the source folder. 

To specify game board size, follow the command line prompts for x and y dimensions. Later improvements can be made by implementing a GUI button interface.
